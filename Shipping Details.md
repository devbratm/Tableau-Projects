# Shipping Details
Your company has tasked you with analyzing your company’s shipping status and how many shipments are completed per week. Your task is to create a new calculation and title it “Ship Status.” This new calculation should show whether the shipment was “Shipped on Time,” “Shipped Early,” or “Shipped Late.” You will also create a filled line chart showing the total number of shipments by order date. Furthermore, you will need to colorize your chart by shipping status, and add Order date, Ship Mode, and Ship Status to the filter. Filter by the Q4 2014 data only.
